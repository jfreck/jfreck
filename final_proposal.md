title: Final Proposal
---

For my final project, I will be revisiting my project from my study abroad experience, which you can see in my index under SEA Project. I will be taking the SST Difference map and giving it an overhaul, applying a number of things I learned in this class to this map to make it a more appealing and interesting display of data and information. If time allows, I will also be revamping the 2018 data with more up to date satellite data, but this will likely be something I do later when I have more time, as the initial work sifting through the rasters was quite tedious.

The overall question of the project was “Are satellite measurements of ocean surface values accurate in the South Pacific?” We answered that question by concluding that, yes, they are accurate in that region, and function as a viable alternative for constantly acquiring in situ data. However, for this iteration and the final project for this class, I suppose the question will be “Can I display this data in a more interesting and eye-catching way using the skills I have learned in this class.”

The data I will be using comes either from MODIS Satellite algorithms or directly from the shipboard instruments used on my voyage. I have all of this data saved to my computer via thumb drive directly from the computers recording the data as it was measured.

I plan on implementing a hex grid analysis to look at the locations we took measurements at, rather than simple dots. The color of the hex will show the temperature values we measured on site. I will also be creating a time based GIF of the maps, showing each cruise track as its own thing. Finally, I will implement 3D mapping by raising the hexes according to the difference value we ascertained during the project (comparing the measurements of the satellite to the in situ ones).

I will know when my question has been answered if at the end, I am sufficiently pleased that the information of the project is presented in a more visually appealing and intriguing manner.

If I can, I would also like to incorporate an SQL database to manage the project, perhaps also implementing some queries to help me sort out the data.

This project is far more involved than the labs because I am working with data that I collected myself and am personally connected to. It involves deeper analysis and is improving upon something that I have already done.

I chose this component because of my personal connection to it. I am quite proud of this research project and am excited to have the chance to iterate on it further. 

Some learning challenges that I foresee are managing old data that, quite frankly, may or may not function as I need it to, needing to reproject EVERYTHING into a CRS where the Pacific Ocean is centered, and figuring out what the best way to display a certain kind of data is. Hopefully, I can create something that will last and aid me in my career endeavors in the future.
